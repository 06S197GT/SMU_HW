                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
                    <p>When comparing poverty percentage to healthcare coverage, we see that as poverty increased, healthcare coverage decreases. Overall, as poverty percentage increases, so to does the population of smokers. Finally, when comparing poverty
                        to the obesity percentage we see a slight increase in obesity as poverty levels increase.</p>

                    <p>Next we compare median age to various health factors. First age vs healthcare coverage. Based on the data, we can see that middle aged population is more likely to have insurance coverage. The moker population within this age group
                        is above 10%. Obesity within this age group is high above 20%.
                    </p>

                    <p>Based on the data, we found that as yearly income increased for an individual, there was a less likelyhood that they would opt for healthcare coverage. Those on the lower end of the income scale were most likely to smoke. Likewise,
                        we also found that as income increases, the obese population was highest on the lower end of the income scale.</p>
